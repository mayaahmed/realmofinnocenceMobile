<h3> Chapter 4  </h3>
<h2> Mean Girls </h2>

Tara, Lata, Geeta, and some  other girls would walk together
to music  class. Lata liked  to play  a mean trick  on Geeta
time and again. She  would ask all the girls to  leave for class
without waiting for Geeta. And every time Geeta arrived late
to class, Lata would secretly snigger away. Tara never liked
this trick but her protests  were ignored. And one day, Tara
found herself arriving late to class to meet a sniggering Lata.

<p> "Lata  and her friends did  not wait for me  today. They
are playing  the trick  they play  on Geeta, regularly, on  me too"
complained Tara to her mother. </p>

<p> "Is that so? Do not wait for them from tomorrow on wards"
declared Tara's mother. </p>

So the next class Tara reached way before any of our friends. When Lata saw Tara she was surprised.

<P> "Why did you not wait for us?" asked Lata. </p>

<p>  "Last time  you  were not  keen on  waiting  for me.  I
thought you may not wait for me  today also. So I came on my
own" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Last time  was a genuine mistake. It  will never happen
again. Please wait for us. Let us walk to class together" pleaded Lata. </P>

<p> "Okay" said Tara. </p>

Lata kept her promise. She never played silly  tricks on Tara again.
