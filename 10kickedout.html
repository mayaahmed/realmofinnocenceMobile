<h3> Chapter 10 </h3>
<h2>Kicked Out Of Home  </h2>

Tara was in  tears. She simply could not  write the alphabet
C. She could write every other alphabet except C. Her mother
was losing patience. Tara was really trying hard.

<p> "Get out of the house. I do not want to raise a daughter
who cannot write C" declared Tara's mother. She was shown the door. </p>

Tara sat outside the door crying. A neighbor came and scolded Tara's mother.

<p> "How can you behave like this  to a child? If you do not
want  her,  I  am  taking  her  to  my  house"  the  neighbor
said. </p>

<p> "She just cannot write C. I don't know what to do. I am at my wits end" said  Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "Come with me child. Your mother is no good. You can stay in my house" said the neighbor. </p>

<p> The  neighbor took  Tara to  her  house. Tara  went and  sat
quietly in a corner. She  looked around at her surroundings.
So this was going to be her  new house. Did she like it? Not
so much. The neighbor lady was  kind. That was a good thing.
Tara decided to  adjust. The lady offered her  food but Tara
had none. Tara  watched the lady and her  kids eating lunch.
This was her new family. </p>


<p> After a good twenty minutes Tara's brother came and said "Mother is calling Tara home". </p>

<p> "Do you want to go? You can stay here with us." said the lady. </p>

<p> "Thank you. But I think I will go home" said Tara. </p> 


<p> "Are you sure?" asked the lady. </p>

<p> "Yes. I am sure" said Tara. </p>


Tara was really happy to get back home. Few days later she even learned how to write C.
