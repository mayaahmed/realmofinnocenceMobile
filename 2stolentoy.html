<h3> Chapter 2  </h3>
<h2> The stolen toy </h2>

<p> Lata arrived at Tara's  door. Lata was a couple of
years  senior  and  was  full of  gaming  ideas.  Tara  felt
privileged that Lata decided to spend time with her. </p>

<p> "Let us play house-house" said Lata. </p>

Lata had  heard about Tara's house-house  toy collection.
These  toys were  small  household items.  Tiny pans,  pots,
spoons,  and ladles.  Tara being  the only  girl child  was
pampered  with  plenty  of  house house  toys.  Girls  loved
playing house-house where  some girl would play  the role of
mother. She would then act as though she was cooking and fed
others.

<p> "You  have plenty of  nice toys" said  Lata. "Playing
with you was fun. I will visit again." </p>

As Lata was leaving she decided to do Tara a favor.

<p> "Remember a few days back Geeta came to play with you?" asked Lata </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Well, Geeta stole a pan from you. I saw it at her place" said Lata. </p>

<p> "I did not notice I had anything missing" said Tara. </p>

Tara never cared much about  her toys. Her mother took great
pleasure in buying her toys  all the time. She just shrugged
the news away. 

<p> "You should go and get it back from her" insisted Lata. </p>

<p> "Let it go. I have plenty" said Tara. </p>


<p> "Can't you  see this is stealing? You must  do the right
thing.  Get it  back  from  Geeta. Come  with  me now"  said
Lata. </p>

It was  late evening. It  was clear that Lata  loved drama.
Tara  followed Lata  to Geeta's  house. Lata  rang the  door
bell. Geeta's mother opened the door.

<p> "Geeta stole a pan from Tara's house the other day. We have come to collect it back" said Lata. </p>

A little  later, Geeta came and  handed back the toy  to
Tara. She  said nothing and  quietly closed the  door. There
was nothing to  say. Lata had betrayed  Geeta's trust. Geeta
had confided in Lata. She never thought Lata would go about
squealing. Moreover,  Lata hardly knew Tara.  Tara could see
Lata felt  very good  about the entire  thing. As  they were
leaving  Tara heard  loud scoldings and  whimpering. The  entire
episode was unpleasant  for Tara. The irony  being that Tara
did  not  care at all about  the  silly old  pan  that caused  all  the
trouble.
