<h3> Chapter 7 </h3>
<h2> The Dog Bite </h2>

Mothi was a  friendly dog. Children loved  playing with him.

<p> One day someone gave Mothi a big, fat, and juicy bone. Geeta
decided to  pet Mothi  when Mothi was  chewing on  the bone.
Mothi growled for  a few minutes before biting  the cheek of
Geeta. Geeta ran home bleeding and crying. </p> 

<p> Soon  a crowd gathered  around Mothi's owner.  Mothi was
declared a  dangerous dog. He  had to  be put to  sleep. The
owner agreed  with a heavy  heart. Mothi was taken  far away
from home  and left at  an animal shelter. </p> 

<p>  All the  children  including Geeta  was  sad. This  was
disproportionate punishment  for Mothi. He was  going to pay
with his life for a bite. </p>

<p> After a few days, Mothi came back looking tired, hungry,
and disheveled. He had somehow  found his way back home. </p>

<p> "Dogs  are incredible animals.  How they can  find their
way  back  home  like  this   is  a  mystery"  said  Mothi's
owner. </p>


<p>  All  was forgiven.  Everyone  was  happy to  see  Mothi
again. </p>

<p> "If we do not  disturb a dog while eating,  we have a friend for life"  said Tara happily. </P>
