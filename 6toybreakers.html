<h3> Chapter 6 </h3>
<h2> The Toy Smashers </h2>

<p> Tara watched  the little boy  unwrap his present. It  was a
battery operated monkey  which could clap when  a button was
pressed.   Tara's family was staying at the boy's place. Tara
never got  such expensive toys.  But her parents  gifted him
this  fascinating  toy monkey.  Tara  and  her siblings  had
played  with  it a  little  back  at  home. Tara  loved  the
clapping monkey. </p> 

<p> Tara waited  for the boy to press the  button that made
the monkey clap. Instead the  boy took the monkey and threw
it hard  at the floor. The  monkey broke to smithereens  in a
matter of seconds. Tara and  her siblings had never seen  any
kid behave like this. They  were clearly shocked. The boy's
parents  were watching.  No  one reprimanded  him. This  was
clearly accepted behavior. </p>


After  a few  days, Tara  visited  a fun fair with  her
family.  Tara's father  bought  them a  small  boat made  of
recycled metal. The  boat would move on water  when a candle
was lit. This toy was  of immense interest when the children
got  home. They  spend hours  watching  the boat  move in  a
bucket filled with water.

<p> The boy wanted this boat.  No one thought of buying him
one because of  how he behaved with his last  gift. Tara and
her  siblings  would not  part  with  their boat.  The  boy
started to wail loudly to the utter amazement of Tara. </p>



<p> "I am tired of all this disturbance because of a stupid boat" said the boy's mother. She then took the boat and threw it on the floor. The boat broke in to many pieces. </p>

<p> "This explains why the kid  thinks that toys are for throwing on the floor" exclaimed Tara.</p>
