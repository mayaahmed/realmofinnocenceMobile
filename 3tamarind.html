<h3> Chapter 3  </h3>
<h2> The Tamarind Tale</h2>

Tara saw  sacks full  of tamarind at  a relative's  place in
Kerala. Tara was  from a city and had never  seen such a lot
of tamarind  in her entire life.  Not even in shops.  It was
like she saw a pot of gold.

<p> "How come you have so much tamarind?" asked Tara </p>

<p> "This is from our farm. We will sell it in the market soon" said  the lady of the house. </p>

<p> "Can I have some tamarind?" asked Tara.</p>

<p> "Take as much as you want" said the lady. </p>

<p> "Really?"  asked Tara  not quite  believing what  she heard.
Tara's mother would forbid her from eating any tamarind. </p>

<p> "Help yourself. Go on" said the pleasant lady.</p>

<p> Tara took an immediate liking to this lady. She was sure
that she  had never met  a better  person in her  life. Tara
took a big handful of tamarind. She also took some salt from
another  sack nearby.  This house  had everything  that Tara
needed. She then  rubbed the tamarind with  salt and wrapped
it carefully in a piece  of paper. Tara munched tamarind all
the way  till she  got back home.  This was  undoubtedly the
happiest day of her life. But  when she arrived home she got
a severe case of diarrhea. </p>

<p> "How  many times I  have told  you not to  eat tamarind?
Look who is sick now?" scolded Tara's mother. </P>

<P> "Tamarind gives you diarrhea? I had no idea" said Tara. </P>

Tara realized, that day, that  her mother was not a terrible
person  for denying  her  tamarind. Tamarind  came with  big
problems.
