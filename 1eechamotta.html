<h3> Chapter 1  </h3>
<h2> The fear of Eecha Motta</h2>

<p> "Eat  fast  otherwise  <em> eecha motta  iddum. </em> " </p>

<p> Tara heard  her mother proclaim.  Eecha motta iddum  meant that the housefly will  lay eggs in
her plate.  </p> 

<p>  Tara looked  at  her plate.  She  wondered whether  the
housefly got  a chance  to lay eggs  already. How  much time
passes before  the housefly  decides to lay  eggs on  a kids
plate? There was no one to  ask. Tara was taking no chances.
Anything that  remotely looked like  eggs was going  out of
her plate. </p>

<p> And as luck would have it,  no dish was spared mustard seeds
by Tara's mother. Every dish  would be tempered with mustard
seeds. There was  plenty of chance that some  of these seeds
were Eecha  motta (eggs  of housefly).  Tara would  pick out
these seeds carefully  before putting any morsel  of food in
her mouth. </p>

<p> "Eat  fast  otherwise  eecha motta  iddum"  repeated  Tara's
mother. </p>

<p> It was taking forever for Tara to get rid of the mustard
seeds and she decided to just grab a handful of food and eat
it. But  she was tortured  by the  fact that she  might have
eaten a  few eecha  motta. Meal  times became  miserable for
little Tara. </p>

<p> One  fine day  Tara saw  pictures  of housefly  eggs at  her
school in the  Biology lab. She was relieved to  see that it
looked quite  different from mustard seeds.  Eecha motta was
white whereas  mustard seeds  were black. Suddenly  Tara was
eating  at  a speed  her  mother  approved of.  Eecha  motta
bothered her no more. </p>
