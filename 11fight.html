<h3> Chapter 11 </h3>
<h2>The Big Brawl </h2>

<p> "Can I borrow some matchsticks?" asked Poonam. Poonam was
Tara's neighbor who was a lot older than her. </p>

<p> "Mother is not home. Come back later for it" said Tara. </p>

<p>  "Give it  to me  now. I  cannot wait  for it  till your
mother's return. I need it now" shouted Poonam. </p>

Tara's siblings came  out to see who was  shouting. They did
not like Poonam's attitude at  all. Without saying a word to
each other, the  children had decided Poonam  is not getting
any  match sticks  from them.  Poonam started  to use  swear
words. The children and Poonam  began a war of words. Poonam
decided to go home. But she  was fuming. She came out to the
balcony and started yelling at them.

<p> Thus  began the  balcony fight.  It became  really loud.
People  walking on  the roads  below had  stopped to  watch.
Poonam was  no match. The  children really had a  talent for
hurling insults. Poonam was  called elephant a lot. Moreover,
while Poonam was  fuming, the children were  really having a
great time. Tara's team was  clearly winning this fight. </p>

<p>  The fight  came to  a  sudden halt  when Tara's  mother
returned. The kids  got a good thrashing. She  had heard the
brawl from quite a distance. She  was shocked to see her own
children  making  all the noise. Tara's  mother was red
with anger and embarrassment. </p>



<p> Poonam was nowhere to be seen for the next few days. She
did not take the opportunity to gloat. Perhaps,  she was afraid
of Tara's mother too.  The fight was never mentioned again. </p>
