<h3> Chapter 5 </h3>
<h2> The Dress Disappointment </h2>

Tara got a chance to take  part in a church dance. The Dance
teacher was a terror. The  only person the teacher liked was
a wiery little  girl everyone called mouse.  All the mothers
were  making dresses  for the  girls for  the dance.  Tara's
mother spend days  adding frills and laces  to Tara's dress.
Needless  to say,  Tara's dress  was  the best.  Tara was  so
looking forward to wear her dress at the dance.

<p> On  the day of  the dance,  the girls and  their dresses
went to the venue before the mothers. The mouse's mother did
not bother  to make a dress  for her. So the  teacher had to
rent one for her. The teacher  looked at all the dresses and
decided to give Tara's dress to the mouse. </p>

<p> "My mother made it for me" protested Tara feebly. </p>

<p> "You can take it back after the dance" said the teacher.
The teacher then gave the mouse's dress to Tara. When Tara's
mother arrived backstage she was surprised to see Tara wearing a different dress.</p>

<p> "What happened to your dress?" asked Tara's mother.  </p>

<p> "The teacher gave it to her" said Tara pointing to the mouse. </p>

<p> "Why did you agree to that?" asked Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "Could I have said  no the teacher?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Of  course you could.  But now it  is too late  to take
your  dress back.  It is  time  for your  show" said  Tara's
mother. </P>

Tara's mother then  went on to fix Tara's  makeup. The dress
was a misfit  for the mouse. It was made  frill by frill for
Tara.  Everyone around  sensed  Tara's disappointment.  They
came around Tara  and told her how wonderful  she looked and
cheered her up. Tara was happy to get her dress back after the dance.

<p> "If anything like this ever happens again, I will say no" said Tara to herself. </p>
