<h3> Chapter 9 </h3>
<h2> Lost  </h2>

<p> "Can you give this sari to the <em> partis </em> for washing?" asked Tara's mother. </p>

  Tara's family was visiting their native place. Partis were
washer women  of the village.  They were washing  clothes at
the stream.  Tara could see  the stream from the  house. She
had also been to the stream a few times before. It should be
no problem.

<p> "Sure" said Tara. She  took her mother's sari and handed
it over to the partis. And she made her way back home. </p>

<p> Tara walked and walked but  she could not see the house.
Any minute now  the house would turn up she  thought. But it
never did.  Tara began to  panic. She was lost.  After what
seemed like an eternity she saw some people. </p>

<p> "I am from Thodupuzha. Can you take me back to Thodupuzha?" she asked the strangers. </p>

<p> "Little girl, this entire town is called Thodupuzha. What is your father's name?" </p>

<p> Tara's  father's name  was no help.  No one  really knew
him. He had left for the city years back. </P>

<p> "Take me back to Thodupuzha. I am from there" said Tara, now almost on the verge of tears. </p>

<p> "This entire town is called Thodupuzha"  said the strangers laughing at the information. </p>

<p> Luckily for Tara, her uncle turned up just then  and said "This child is ours."  </p> 

<p> Tara was safe. She  returned home. She felt really silly
about  getting lost.  Tara's mother  got many  scoldings for
sending Tara  alone to the stream.  Tara was given a  lot of
information  about family  name, house  name, and  emergency
contact names, that day. </p>
