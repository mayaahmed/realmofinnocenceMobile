<h3> Chapter 8 </h3>
<h2>The Fablers </h2>

One day, while visiting a  park, Tara and her brother saw a crow's nest
with birdlings.  They had never  seen a bird's  nest before.
They  were full  of  questions. They  were  thrilled by  the
bird's nest.

<p> A couple of  days later Tara said " When  I went to play
today, I saw a peacock's nest. The peacock gave me a chocolate. It was very tasty." </p>

<p> "How come you did not show it to me?" asked her brother. </p>

<p> "The  peacock said  I should not  talk about  his secret
nest  to anyone.  Only I  am allowed  to visit.  The peacock
trusts me." said Tara. </p>

<p> "That is okay.  I found an eagle's nest the  other day. He
gave me  a delicious cake. He  also gave me some  toys." said
Tara's brother. </p>

<p> "My peacock gave  me toys too. In fact he  gave me a big
doll. I left it near his nest.  I will go back and play with
it later" said Tara. </p>

For days afterwards,  Tara and her brother  would talk about
all  the animal  friends  they had  found  in secret.  These
included elephants,  lions, rabbits,  crocodiles, and  so on.
One day Tara decided that she had taken the game too far.

<p> "I was just making up stories of those animal friends. I do not have any" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Me too" said her brother. And that was the end of story
telling for the two of them for a while. </p>
