<h3> Chapter 12 </h3>
<h2>The Rotten Eggs Question </h2>


 Tara's  class teacher had a favorite word problem.

<p> "If there are twenty eggs in a basket and ten were rotten how many were
good?" </p> 

This was Tara's favorite problem too. All math that involved
tens were always fun. Tara was quite comfortable with the tens. 

<p> "Tomorrow a  different teacher will
come to  supervise your  quiz. You never  know what  she will
ask. Prepare well" said Tara's class teacher. </p> 


Though the students worried a lot, the quiz was actually prepared
by the class teacher. The quiz was only read out by the new teacher.

<p> "If there were twenty eggs in a basket" began the new teacher. </p>

<p> "Ten were rotten" said Tara automatically. </p>

<p> "Why did you say that? I will deduct your marks" scolded the teacher. </p>

<p> Tara was really frightened. She had not expected such a sharp
reaction. Tara had thought that the teacher would be pleased she knew
the question. The teacher was visibly angry. After a considerable
pause, the teacher continued with the quiz. </p>

<p> "If there were twenty eggs in a basket, and ten were rotten, how many
eggs were good?" asked the teacher. </p>


Tara wrote the answer down as ten. She worried for many days
after wards how many points the teacher might have deducted.
When the report  card came, Tara had  scored hundred percent
on her quiz.

<p> "Rotten threats" said Tara to herself.</p>
